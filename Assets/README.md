# Personal-PORTFLIO

Evolving an initial portfolio webpage, the files associated with this repository (cleanly stored in an 'Assets' folder, per grader reccomendation) instantiate a personal, professional page that includes an introductory blurb about the page-creator, a portfolio of related projects, and social media contacts (in the form of social media icons). No JavaScript was used in the development of this iteration of the page, simply HTML and CSS. All buttons/navbar links either scroll the user to the relevant section of the page, or open a new tab displaying the page-creator's résumé. 

Below, a link to the deployed site, as well as a screenshot of the 'final' product.
